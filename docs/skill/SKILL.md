name: video-loom
description: Use this skill whenever the user wants to create a finished video from a topic, title, idea, prompt, or script with Loom (video-loom). This includes short-form, voice-over, educational, marketing, and social-media videos produced by the LangGraph editing agent. Also use it when the user mentions Loom, video-loom, provides this Skill URL, asks an AI agent to install or configure video-loom, needs missing API keys identified, wants a failed generation repaired, or wants a generated MP4 located and delivered. Use this skill when the expected outcome is a final video file, not setup instructions.
compatibility: Requires an AI agent with terminal, network, filesystem, and long-running command support. Supports macOS and Windows and uses uv exclusively.

# Loom Video Generation

The user only needs to provide a video topic or script. Complete installation, configuration reuse, generation, waiting, and final MP4 delivery automatically. Do not stop after giving instructions or commands.

## Required Behavior

1. Ask the user only for required API credentials that are missing, rejected, or unusable. Combine all required credentials into one request.
2. Do not ask for confirmation before installing, generating, waiting, using defaults, or returning the result.
3. Do not create or repeatedly update a detailed plan for a standard generation request. Send one short progress update and execute.
4. Run the helper as one foreground command with a timeout of at least 30 minutes.
5. Never poll with `sleep`, `echo`, `ps`, repeated `ls`, or repeated `tail`. If the terminal returns a resumable session ID, continue waiting on that same session.
6. Do not read the full log after success. Read only the short reported error or the relevant log tail after failure.
7. Never print API keys, tokens, the full `config.toml`, or credential-bearing configuration fragments.

## Defaults

Unless the user requests otherwise, generate one Chinese `9:16` portrait video with the LangGraph editing agent, AI-generated scene clips, the default Chinese Edge TTS voice, subtitles, and background music. Prefer the video-loom checkout that contains this skill; otherwise install under `~/video-loom`.

## Execution

### 1. Locate the helper

Resolve `SKILL_DIR` from this `SKILL.md` file. The helper is the adjacent `loom_agent.py`. Set the terminal tool's working directory to `SKILL_DIR` and invoke the helper by its relative filename. Do not put the absolute helper path in the command, and do not run an extra `ls` or `dir` check.

This is required on Windows because some agent terminal validators remove backslashes from absolute paths embedded in commands. Using `loom_agent.py` with `workdir=SKILL_DIR` avoids that failure and works on both macOS and Windows.

If the client loaded only the remote `SKILL.md`, download the helper from the official repository to a temporary directory, then use that temporary directory as the command working directory:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iammm0/video-loom/main/docs/skill/loom_agent.py
```

### 2. Run the helper

Do not run a separate `uv --version` preflight. Run the helper directly. If the shell explicitly reports that uv is missing, install uv and retry the same helper command once.

macOS uv installation:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Windows PowerShell uv installation:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Use this foreground command with `workdir=SKILL_DIR` and a timeout of at least 30 minutes:

```bash
uv run --no-project --python 3.11 python loom_agent.py --subject "<video topic>"
```

On Windows, do not try absolute backslash paths, absolute forward-slash paths, or copies in the workspace before this relative command. If a terminal tool reports `referenced_script_path_missing`, verify that its working directory is exactly `SKILL_DIR` and retry the relative command once. Do not cycle through path variants.

Do not use Docker, Conda, system pip, or a manually managed virtual environment.

## Exit Handling

### Exit code 0: deliver the result

Successful output has this form:

```text
LOOM_RESULT
VIDEO_FILE=<absolute path>/final-1.mp4
TASK_DIR=<absolute path>/storage/tasks/<task_id>
LOG_FILE=<absolute path>/run-<task_id>.log
RESULT_FILE=<absolute path>/latest-result.json
```

`loom_agent.py` emits `VIDEO_FILE` only after confirming that the file exists and is non-empty. Do not run another `ls`, `stat`, or file validation command.

If the terminal reports `exitCode=0` but truncates the output or returns a history-file reference without `LOOM_RESULT`, do not infer failure and do not inspect old logs. Read this file once:

```text
~/video-loom/.agent-logs/video-loom/latest-result.json
```

If the helper ran from a local checkout, the same file lives at `<project-root>/.agent-logs/video-loom/latest-result.json`.

Treat `status=completed` as success. Return only the absolute video path and a concise description, for example:

```text
The video is ready.
Topic: ...
Video file: /absolute/path/to/final-1.mp4
Summary: Chinese portrait video with voice-over, subtitles, and background music.
```

### Exit code 10: request credentials once

`LOOM_NEEDS_INPUT` includes only the required fields, recommended LLM providers and signup links, custom OpenAI-compatible requirements, and the Seedance / VolcEngine Ark signup link. Ask only for the listed values and do not request credentials already found in `config.toml`.

After the user responds, rerun the same foreground command with only the required environment variables:

```text
LOOM_LLM_PROVIDER
LOOM_LLM_API_KEY
LOOM_LLM_BASE_URL
LOOM_LLM_MODEL_NAME
LOOM_SEEDANCE_API_KEY
```

### Exit code 1: repair or report

Use `LOOM_ERROR` and `LOG_FILE` to repair a recoverable problem and retry once. Ask the user only if the repair requires a new API key. If the retry fails, report the failed stage, a short error, and the log path.

A terminal-tool path validation error is not a video-generation failure because the helper did not start. Correct the working directory and retry the relative command once. Never ask the user to copy `loom_agent.py`, run commands manually, or confirm whether the agent should continue.

## Configuration and Background Fallback

The helper may read the complete local `config.toml` to reuse existing settings, but it must never print its contents. It reuses a working LLM provider automatically. Seedance can also reuse a configured VolcEngine Ark key.

Use background mode only if the agent platform cannot wait for a foreground process. Wait for the platform's process-completion notification without polling, then read `latest-result.json` once.

## Scope

- Support macOS and Windows only.
- Use uv and the video-loom CLI only.
- Do not start Docker, WebUI, or API services.
- Do not run multiple video jobs concurrently.
- Pass additional video requirements after `--`. Run `cli.py --help` once only when an unfamiliar option must be verified.
